# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

Mostly confident

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

I feel confident making a method, but using the language to get the correct output needs some work.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

A few questions came up that I needed to use google for, I believe we weren't taught all the techniques we needed deliberately.

Can i apply multiple methods to a string?
